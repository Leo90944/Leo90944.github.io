### CPSC 120

* Lab 5

    Lab 5, part 1 was a favorite because it introduced me to using code for math problems we have seen many times before. I was able to implement functions that involved the user to input any number for length and width to determine the area of a rectangle. This lab helped me better understand the value of coding for math as it can be used to assist in calculating complex problems.

* Lab 6
    Lab 6, part 1 was a favorite because it introduced food and a fun way to implement sandwich orders. I was able to use functions that involved argument size and error messages to create a program that gives sandwich orders. It helped give me an understanding of what it  could be like doing online orders at restaurants.

* Lab 11
    Lab 11, part 1 was a challenging lab but was still one of my favorites as it helped me understand columns and rows. I had struggled with tables and rows however I was able to create functions that helped me isolate specific pizza_is and prices and determine price per calorie. This lab helped me understand the fundamentals of using tables in code.
